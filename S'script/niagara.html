        <p>This time was Niagara falls, Canadian side. I've never been to the American side but I can say Canadian side is better. I mean most of the attractions or the restaurants are gathering in the Canadian side. So without saying, the biggest spot to see is the Falls and you don't really have anything else to do other than that.</p>

        <p>This is a picture from the boat that I waited for a half hour to get tickets and nearly an hour to actually get on a boat. The boat goes really close to the falls that you definitely get wet even if you are wearing a poncho. But I think it depends on where you are on a boat.</p>

        <p>You do have to wait long to get tickets for this 'going behind the falls tour', but you can actually go behind the falls. I don't reccomend doing this for people who don't like closed place because you have to walk through a small tiny tunnel for minutes.

        <p><span class="highlight">Although the fall was cool, I personally didn't love this because I never felt like I was breathing untill I got out of the tunnel and the inside of the tunnel was so moisty.</span> But if you are really interested seeing behind the falls, you should definitely go!</p></p>

        <p>On the last day, we went to the Niagara-on-the-lake that's the downstream the river to have a lunch. You can't really see what it's like from the picture. It's more like a rural area and you should visit here if you are looking for good food. It's much better than what you can find in downtown.</p>

          This is where I ate pasta. If you are planning to celebrate something, this would be the best place.
