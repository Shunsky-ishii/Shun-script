        <img src="img/iceland/street.jpg">
        <p>So I went to Reykjavik, capital of Iceland this winter break. Don't ask me why I chose to go to Iceland in winter, but it wasn't that cold that I never used all the equipments I prepared and bought from Target. I think Iceland is pretty a good place to visit, but <span class="highlight">you don't really have a choice of attractions so you can't miss anything important there.</span> As I was writing, I realized that I didn't take any picture of food which I regret a lot so I just say that they were great. I ate meat three days in a row. Since I didn't take any picture of food, I'm gonna write a bunch of places I went. Most of them are super famous you probably can find it online.</p>

            Well... I have no idea how to pronounce the name of this church but I can say this is like the <span class="highlight">symbol of Reykjavik</span>. It is that huge I think you can see it from anywhere.</p>

            https://www.bluelagoon.com/</a><br>
            I went to the Blue Lagoon twice during the trip and this is the place made me feel down. Each of us paid about $30 to get a bathrobe so I wouldn't get cold while walking to place to place, but <span class="highlight">my bathrobe got stolen</span> by someone who thought it's a free service or something. Of course I had to walk in a deadly cold temperature. I still feel mad even now I'm writing this. Also it was so crowded so don't expect anything like what's on the official website. Everything else was perfect, especially the dinner.

          Almost every attraction in Iceland has something to do with the nature, this is one of them. I think the Thingvellir National Park is the most popular tourists' destination. <span class="highlight">You can walk on where Eurasian and the American plates drift apart.</span>

          I honestly don't know what to say about this waterfall. It was as great as the Niagara Falls. Really, I have nothing to say or complain. All I can say for this is visit the website to learn about this more!

          According to the website, this is the most visited active geyser. I waited like three minutes for water to come out. It was kinda funny to see everyone gathering around the geyser and staring at it.

          Seeing an aurora(polar light) by any chance was one of my goal. Did I see it? Well, though the weather wasn't great for the entire week, I did... on <span class="important">VR</span> (It was actually so good). Overall, I think Iceland is recommended for people who are patient enough to tolerate crazily crowded changing room of the Blue Lagoon and for people who love the nature.
